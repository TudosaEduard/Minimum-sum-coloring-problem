# Minimum sum coloring problem (Introduction)

The optimization problem called "Minimum Sum Coloring Problem" (MSCP) consists of assigning different colors to each node of a graph so that the total cost of assigning colors is minimal. The total cost is defined as the sum of the colors assigned to each node. This is an NP-hard problem, and therefore there are a number of approaches to finding efficient solutions.

## Short historic

The Minimum Sum Coloring Problem (MSCP) is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem that was first formulated in 1982 by Gary and Johnson, two of the pioneers of computer complexity theory. This problem is a generalization of the classical graph coloring problem, in which one seeks to assign different colors so that no two neighboring nodes have the same.

In MSCP, the objective is to associate node colors such that they are minimal and no two neighboring nodes have the same color. This problem is considered to be NP-hard, and therefore there is no efficient algorithm that provides optimal solutions for all instances. Consequently, many solution methods for MSCP focus on finding an approximate solution that is as close as possible to the optimal solution.

In recent years, coloring problems have been studied within graph theory and algorithms, with applications in various fields such as communication networks, transportation, and circuit design. Thus, research on MSCP problems has continued to be an important research topic in combinatorial computing and with many practical and theoretical applications.
