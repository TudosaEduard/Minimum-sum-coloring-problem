# Minimum sum coloring problem (Introduction)

The optimization problem called "Minimum Sum Coloring Problem" (MSCP) consists of assigning different colors to each node of a graph so that the total cost of assigning colors is minimal. The total cost is defined as the sum of the colors assigned to each node. This is an NP-hard problem, and therefore there are a number of approaches to finding efficient solutions.
